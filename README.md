## # 👋 Hi there, I’m Jacob Fernandez  

🎮 **Gameplay Programmer | UIW MGD Student | Passionate Game Developer**  

I’m a senior **Gameplay Programmer** at the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) working toward an accelerated master’s degree in gameplay programming. My focus is on **C++**, **C#**, and **game engine development**, with hands-on experience in **Unity, Unreal Engine 5, and custom OpenGL engines**.  

My passion lies in creating systems that *feel good to play*—from moment-to-moment mechanics like FPS movement and AI behavior, to larger systems like procedural generation and rendering pipelines. I strive to bridge the gap between **technical precision** and **game feel**, making gameplay both functional and immersive.
